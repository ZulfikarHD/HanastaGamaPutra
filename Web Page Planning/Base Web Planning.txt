Great choice with "Hanasta Gama Putra" - it has a strong, professional sound! For a web-based company profile that's professional yet simple and follows best UI/UX practices, here's my recommendation:

## **Recommended Page Structure (5-7 Pages)**

### **1. Home/Landing Page**
- Hero section with company name, tagline, and compelling visual
- Brief overview of services (construction + supply)
- Key statistics or achievements
- Call-to-action buttons
- Quick navigation to other sections

### **2. About Us**
- Company story and mission
- Core values
- Timeline/milestones
- Leadership team (with photos)
- Company culture and approach

### **3. Services**
- **Construction Services** (with subcategories)
- **Construction Supplies** (with product categories)
- Process overview
- Quality standards

### **4. Projects/Portfolio**
- Featured projects with before/after photos
- Project categories (residential, commercial, etc.)
- Case studies (2-3 detailed examples)

### **5. Contact**
- Contact form

### **Optional Additional Pages:**
- **News/Blog** (for SEO and engagement)

## **UI/UX Design Principles for Professional Feel:**

### **Visual Design:**
- **Color Scheme**: Earth tones (browns, grays, blues) to reflect construction industry
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts (like Inter, Roboto, or Open Sans)
- **White Space**: Plenty of breathing room between sections
- **Imagery**: High-quality photos of projects, team, and equipment

### **User Experience:**
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works on all devices
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized images and minimal animations
- **Clear Navigation**: Sticky header with logical menu structure
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential info first, details on demand
- **Trust Signals**: Certifications, testimonials, contact info prominently displayed

### **Content Strategy:**
- **Scannable Content**: Bullet points, short paragraphs, clear headings
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Important information stands out
- **Action-Oriented**: Clear CTAs like "Get Quote," "View Projects," "Contact Us"

## **Technical Considerations:**
- **Single Page Application (SPA)** vs **Multi-Page**: I'd recommend a traditional multi-page site for better SEO
- **Content Management**: Consider a simple CMS for easy updates
- **Performance**: Optimize for Google PageSpeed scores
- **SEO**: Proper meta tags, structured data, local SEO optimization
